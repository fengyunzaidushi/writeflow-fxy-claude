# Review summary
review_summary: |
  Story 1.2 demonstrates exceptional software development practices. The implementation:
  
  1. Perfectly follows existing SlashCommand interface patterns established in Story 1.1
  2. Implements all 4 content optimization commands with robust functionality
  3. Provides dual input support (file paths and direct text) with proper validation
  4. Includes comprehensive error handling and user-friendly messages
  5. Features complete test coverage with edge case validation
  6. Updates help system appropriately with new command category
  7. Maintains backward compatibility and code quality standards
  8. Uses appropriate tool integrations for each command type
  
  This is a model implementation that demonstrates excellent understanding of
  the existing codebase and architectural patterns. Zero changes required.
